    "The idea was to take some kind of application or workflow that currently runs in a traditional architecture (on-prem cluster, workstation, even all on the same cloud VM) and re-architect it so it takes advantage of things like containerization (so it can be easily shared/ported) and serverless functions. We can go as complicated as we want, so long as we keep it modular. I think with this many people we can go slightly complex, but some simple data transformation seems like a good place to start. The main thing I want to know is what kind of data (file types, database, etc) we'll be working with and the software/languages/applications/transformations that are typically involved, so I can get up to speed. Amanda made it sound like you guys already had a workflow in mind, but I think I may have misinterpreted that.\n",

    "Sounds good.  We have a Python code that reads NetCDF data files and returns regional and temporal subsets based on user provided parameters.  This could be containerized into a serverless function.\n",

    "The data weâ€™re considering here would be climate model output.  For example, surface temperature in NetCDF format defined on a regular latitude/longitude grid (global coverage).  Time period covers most of the 20th century to present.  An example data subset workflow would be that a user requests surface temperature data over the continental US for the years 1990-2020.  The serverless function would process the input parameters (region and time) and return the subsetted data.\n",

    "Input data could be stored in S3, and output data could likewise be written to temporary S3 bucket where user can access it."
